> 收集些编程&软件开发领域的一些概念或者论述，不知道怎么定义这些有意思的小句子，暂且命名为段子好了。

Joe老爷子的似乎一直都蛮多

- programming is not about code, it’s about understanding.

- everything is a process.

- process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.

- message passing is the only way for processes to interact.

- processes have unique names.

- if you know the name of a process you can send it a message.

- processes share no resources.

- error handling is non-local.

- processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.

Martin Fowler的很多论述也是一语中的

- one of the challenges of software development is that you can only make decisions based on the imperfect information that you currently have to hand
